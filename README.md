# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Repository! This repository showcases various machine learning projects and models created using Python. Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll find:

## ðŸ“š ML Algorithms
- **Linear Regression**: Predict continuous values using linear relationships.
- **Logistic Regression**: Classify data into categories based on logistic functions.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Model non-linear relationships with polynomial equations.
- **Decision Tree**: Make decisions based on a tree-like model of choices.
- **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: Classify data by finding the optimal hyperplane.
- **Naive Bayes**: Apply probabilistic classification based on Bayesâ€™ theorem.
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**: Classify data based on the closest neighbors.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Group data into clusters based on similarity.

## ðŸ”§ ML Models
- **Created ML Models**: Developed and evaluated various machine learning models for different applications.
